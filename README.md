This is the code of a prototype that creates 3D city models from a combination of a 2D map and a point cloud.
It was made for my secondment at the [Ordnance Survey](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk), Southampton, UK.
So far, it has only been tested with sample data around Exeter, UK, which was supplied by OS.

It achieves similar results to [3dfier](https://github.com/tudelft3d/3dfier) and [City4CFD](https://github.com/tudelft3d/city4cfd) but the ultimate aim is to have a more general approach that works in more countries.

More information to come.
